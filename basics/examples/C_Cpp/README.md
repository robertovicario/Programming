# Information

## Configuration

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal application.
2. Navigate to the target directory: `~/basics/examples/c_cpp`. If you're not already there, use the `cd` command to change directories.
3. Execute the configuration script by entering `./config.sh` and pressing Enter.

## Execution

To run your code:

1. Change directory to the build folder by entering `cd build` and pressing Enter.
2. Execute your compiled code by entering `./your_executable` and pressing Enter.

## Information

If you see a "Permission Denied" error when running `./config.sh`, it means you lack permission to execute the script. Grant execute permissions with:

```bash
chmod +x config.sh
```

- Update the `CMakeLists.txt` file to include new executables or dependencies as needed.
